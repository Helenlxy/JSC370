# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral illness produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome. It has had a terrible effect on the globe's demography, resulting in the deaths of almost 5.3 million people around the world. It has risen to become the most serious global health problem since the 1918 influenza epidemic. COVID-19 has been a worldwide pandemic since 2019, and we have all been affected by it.

The light at the end of the tunnel is getting closer thanks to rapid developments in science and technology. Major vaccination efforts are currently underway to immunize the world's population. According to data collated by Our World in Data from health authorities, 39.7% of the world's population has received at least one dose, with nearly 2.1 billion people completely vaccinated as of today.

Many analyses have been performed on all kinds of datasets for COVID-19 to find ways to fight it. For this project, we mainly analyzed COVID-19 data from [the COVID tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/). The COVID tracking project collected state-level metrics for COVID-19 cases, tests, hospitalizations, and outcomes from 2020/01/13 to 2021/03/07. The primary question we investigated with these data is whether the number and the trend of confirmed cases differ from state to state and whether it's associated with vaccination, population and distribution of age groups.
