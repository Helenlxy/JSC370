# How to acquire data

[The COVID tracking](https://covidtracking.com/) project provides data API to download data. For example, to acquire state-level metrics for COVID-19 cases, tests, hospitalizations, and outcomes from 2020/01/13 to 2021/03/07, we can use https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.csv.

[Centers for Disease Contol and Prevention](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc) also provides data API so that we can acquire vaccination data on 2021-01-03 using https://data.cdc.gov/resource/unsk-b7fc.csv?date=2021-01-03T00:00:00.000.

State data can be read from https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv and download from [us_census_data](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/associated-data/tree/master/us_census_data).
